# baconboard

## What is it?

Inspired by keyboard history, the baconboard is a harmony of attributes from vintage and modern layouts in one handmade, open source design. Features include an ortholinear layout with southpaw numpad, QMK firmware, [Space Cadet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard)-esque uniform modifier keys, split spacebar, and a line nav arrow cluster a la the [Apple M0116](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Apple_Standard_Keyboard) (but with a more sensible order ←↓↑→).

Our goals as hobbyists were to keep costs low, learn new skills, and give back to the community in the form of documentation. You could say this is our version of "endgame". Currently, the baconboard exists in only one form, the "Handwire Edition". We are hoping to design a "PCB Edition" in the near future.
