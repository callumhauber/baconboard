# Baconboard Wiki

## Getting Started
Greetings, netizen! This wiki contains build guides for the baconboard and a knowledge base for keyboard builders.

To make a baconboard, you'll need the following:
- Soldering skills (both thru-hole and SMD for the Amoeba Variant, or thru-hole only for the Freehand Variant).
- Access to a 3D printer and laser cutter, or access to paid services for such manufacturing.
- Patience.

If this is your first hand-wiring keyboard project, welcome aboard. We highly recommend you visit the [Knowledge Base](#knowledge-base) before diving in. Currently, this wiki has documentation for two baconboard variants. More will be added as the project evolves! Choose one based on your skill level and familiarity with hand-wiring keyboards:

**Amoeba Variant**

The baconboard was originally designed to use [Amoeba single switch PCBs](https://keeb.io/products/amoeba-single-switch-pcbs) for faster and simpler hand-wiring, as it is a fairly large keyboard. The Amoeba PCBs are quite cheap and only add ~$15 USD to the total cost. We feel the benefits are well worth the price. **We recommend that you build this variant, as this is what we've built and tested ourselves**.

**Freehand Variant**

Looking for a skill-building project or already familiar with hand-wiring? You can use thru-hole diodes instead, forego the Amoeba PCBs, and wire the matrix freestyle. For great step-by-step guides to hand-wiring diodes, switches, and row/column matrices, check out [A modern handwiring guide - stronger, cleaner, easier](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=9qcrtivurrt8cjpjd3u7i5iqaole6kmo&topic=87689.msg2364043#msg2364043) and [Matt3o's handwiring guide](https://matt3o.com/hand-wiring-a-custom-keyboard/).

## Knowledge Base
This wiki's broader goal (beyond documenting the baconboard project itself) is to flatten the rather steep learning curve of keyboard building. Whether you're taking your first steps into the hobby or a seasoned veteran, we hope you can find something useful here. From basic keyboard anatomy to writing custom QMK firmware, we are trying to gradually amass a definitive collection of best practices and documentation in a single, elegant, navigable format.
