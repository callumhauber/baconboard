# Baconboard Build Guide

## Getting Started
Greetings, netizen! To make a baconboard, you'll need the following skills:
- Soldering (both thru-hole and SMD for the Amoeba Variant, or thru-hole only for the Freehand Variant)
- Creating and building QMK firmware
- Flashing a keyboard microcontroller with QMK firmware
- Patience

### Choose Your Variant

**Amoeba Variant**
The baconboard handwire edition was originally designed to use [Amoeba single switch PCBs](https://keeb.io/products/amoeba-single-switch-pcbs) for faster hand-wiring, as it is a fairly large keyboard. **We recommend that you build this variant, as this is what we've built and tested ourselves**.

**Freehand Variant**
Looking for a longer project or already familiar with hand-wiring? You can use thru-hole diodes instead and forego the Amoeba PCBs in favor of freehand wiring. For great step-by-step guides to hand-wiring diodes, switches, and row/column matrices, check out [A modern handwiring guide - stronger, cleaner, easier](https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=9qcrtivurrt8cjpjd3u7i5iqaole6kmo&topic=87689.msg2364043#msg2364043) and [Matt3o's handwiring guide](https://matt3o.com/hand-wiring-a-custom-keyboard/).
