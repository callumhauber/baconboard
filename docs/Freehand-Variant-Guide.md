# Baconboard Build Guide - Amoeba Variant

## Parts List
Here is everything you'll need to build your very own baconboard.

### Keycaps
- 69x 1U  
- 9x 1.75U
- 1x 2U
- 1x vertical 2U (for numpad, only different if using non-uniform profile keycaps)
- 1x 2.25U
- 1x 2.75U
Uniform profile keycaps (e.g. DSA) are recommended, as the baconboard layout is highly nonstandard.

### Switches
- 82x switches (MX or Alps)

### Stabilizers
- 4x 2U PCB-mount stabilizers

### Electronics
- 100x [1N4148 Diodes](https://keeb.io/products/1n4148-diodes)
- 1x [Stampy RP2040 Microcontroller](https://keeb.io/collections/diy-parts/products/stampy-rp2040-usb-c-controller-board-for-handwiring)
You may choose to use a different microcontroller, but this guide and our firmware is written for the Stampy. Proceed at your own risk, and remember to modify the firmware as needed for your chosen controller. The controller needs to support 5 rows and 18 columns, for a total of 23 GPIO (unless you want to change the wiring as well to combine multiple rows/columns).
